Procedure: 
I generated clustering silhouettes of 2-9 clusters and saved them in a file named figures found in my workplace directory.

Observations:
Looking through the figures, I observed (subjectively) that the silhouettes with the smallest negative silhouette values 
(both in terms of quantity and magnitude) seemed to be the 3 and 4 clusters, with 4 clusters having the smallest negative values in 
both quantity and magnitude.

Plotting colors in 3-space

After loading my data using importdata([filename.txt]), I separated the data into three vectors:
x = data(:,1)
y = data(:,2)
z = data(:,3)

then used scatter3(x,y,z) to generate a scatterplot in three dimensions

Observations:

Since I stripped the rgb values of distinguishing characteristics such as rank and year, any sort of
pattern I find given the stripped values should correspond to any underlying structure of the book cover colors as a whole.
Furthermore, the most revealing insights into the structure of the data may not be where the data points are, but rather where they 
are not. In other words, my intuition tells me that it would be revealing if I could find holes of some sort where no covers lie. 

Future analyses may involve separating data by year and rank. Again, a heat map-esque plot with x-axis as year and y-axis as rank would be 
qualitatively interesting. Furthermore, if I got such a heat map, I could actually look at the average color value of the heat map
as a whole which I would expect to reveal the centroid of the data for a single cluster. 

Furthermore, if I could actually take the color map and look for a sort of eigen cover perhaps I could find a 'basis' to my color map.
I would expect this basis to contain as its eigenvectors the centroids of the best fit clustering model.

Finally, I need to think about the best way to package this analysis. For packaging, I should refer to the link from professor Bothun.
